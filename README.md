🧠 Building a Decision Tree Classifier: A Journey into Predictive Analytics 🌳

For this task, I developed a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. Using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I dove into the intricacies of predictive modeling and classification.

🔍 Key Steps Undertaken:

Data Loading & Exploration: Utilized Pandas to load and inspect the dataset, identifying key features like 'age', 'job', 'balance', and 'campaign'.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. For example, 'job' and 'marital status' were converted into numerical values to feed into the model.

Feature Engineering: Added relevant features like 'contact duration' and 'previous outcomes' to refine model predictions.

Model Training: Implemented a decision tree classifier using Scikit-learn and optimized it through hyperparameter tuning to achieve better accuracy.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, gaining insights into its predictive power.

💡 Key Insights:

-> Age & Product Purchase: Customers between 30-40 years old had the highest likelihood of purchasing.

-> Previous Campaign Success: Customers who previously responded positively to marketing campaigns were more likely to purchase again.

-> Job & Purchase Likelihood: Professionals and self-employed individuals had higher purchase probabilities compared to other job categories.

📈 Learning Outcomes:

Gained hands-on experience in implementing decision tree classifiers and feature selection.

Improved skills in data preprocessing, including one-hot encoding and scaling.

Enhanced understanding of model evaluation metrics and their real-world implications.
